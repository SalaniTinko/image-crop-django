hey:)

I upload images to wasabi through their official api "boto3".


Go to app/views.py, at line 16:
  The function named "upload" does all handling.
  I've added comments to explain the flow.

  Please don't remove any files or folders from this project, it might cause errors.


Go to settings.py:
  line 126, 127 defines your wasabi keys and bucket name,
  WASABI_KEY_SECRET and WASABI_KEY and BUCKET_NAME

  Incase you change any api key or bucket name, please update these variables.

  Api keys are here https://console.wasabisys.com/#/access_keys
  You can't see api secret on website coz it's only visible at time of creating api key.
